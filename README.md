# News-Topic-Classifier-Using-BERT
# Objective:
Fine-tune a transformer model (e.g., BERT) to classify news headlines into topic categories.
# Dataset:
AG News Dataset (Available on Hugging Face Datasets)
# Instructions:
● Tokenize and preprocess the dataset

● Fine-tune the bert-base-uncased model using Hugging Face Transformers

● Evaluate the model using accuracy and F1-score

● Deploy the model using Streamlit or Gradio for live interaction
# Skills Gained:
● NLP using Transformers

● Transfer learning & fine-tuning

● Evaluation metrics for text classification

● Lightweight model deployment
